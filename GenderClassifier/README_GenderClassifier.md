# GenderClassifier
This program uses scikit-learn to train various different classifiers on a data set of body metrics(height,weight & shoe-size) assigned as male or female. Later this can be used to predict the Gender given the body metrics. Also we can compare the results of different classifiers and their accuracy.

#Dependencies - Sci-kit Learn, scipy & numpy
